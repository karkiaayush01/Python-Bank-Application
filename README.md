For the frontend modules, you can install all the required packages with the following command in the terminal:
npm install 

All the required backend python modules are stored in requirements.txt. You can create a virtual environment first and install the required dependencies in the terminal.

Creating and activating a virtual environment: 
Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scritps\activate

macOS and Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


Installing required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
